## Why?
One day, in computer science class we were asked to program a way to calculate the Fibonacci serie to train recursition. Since me and another classmate finished early, we optimised the algorithm for fun and to get big numbers. We also added a logging system to try to predict how much time was needed for the next number to come out. The problem is that I just found out that we were calculating one number higher than we thought so I corrected it a bit today.

## Versions
1.0: Upload.

## How to install and use it?
For this section, we will assume that you know how to use a computer but know nothing about programming. If you need any help, [contact us](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie/blob/main/README.en.md#contact-us).<br><br>

First, you're gonna need python. For this part, check [my tutorial on how to do so](https://github.com/reza0310/Tutorials/blob/python/README.en.md).<br>
Congratulations! You now have Python!<br><br>

Then you're gonna have to install the project. First download it as ZIP like you did for the last one from [this link](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie) (wich might be the link you're coming from). Then extract it into the parent project's folder. If it asks you if you want to replace files, approve.<br>
Congratulations! You just finished the installation!<br><br>

Now, to use it, check the [file-by-file description](https://github.com/reza0310/ProjetTradingPythonPOO/blob/main/README.en.md#file-by-file-description) to know wich script to execute and why.

## File-by-file description

- [README.md](https://github.com/reza0310/ProjetTradingPythonPOO/blob/main/README.md): A file linking all languages README files.
- [Générateur.py](https://github.com/reza0310/fibonacci/blob/main/G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rateur.py): EXECUTABLE. The script we used to generate the numbers. Goes back to 0 after the current number is generated and logged.
- [log.txt](https://github.com/reza0310/fibonacci/blob/main/log.txt): A log file. Contains informations about the calculs made. The actual version is from before today's correction even if data got corrected too.
- Fibonacci \[x].txt: Contains the \[x]th number from the fibonacci serie.

## How to contribute?
Don't. It's a too good memory to modify it so if you want your own version fork it.

## FAQ
No question were ever asked to me.
